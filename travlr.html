        <p>Exploring new places and taking trips has to be one of the most exciting parts of life experiences. Out of this great experience, think about the last time you went on a vacation or trip, the planning process probably wasn’t as smooth or easy as you’d wanted. The travel planning process can be very daunting especially if you don’t know a lot about the destination, or know anyone there.</p>
        <p class="big-text italics">This led to thinking about the problem,</p>
        <p class="big-text">How might we make trip planning a simple and less stressful activity in traveling?</p>

        <p>Travelr presents a new approach to solo or group trip planning through access to personalized travel information. Designing travelr was aimed at solving the tedious process involved in planning trips alone or as a group by providing access to travel guides, tourists spots, and other related information on the destination based on users’ interests, also itinerary planning either manually inputted or automatically generated through synced booking emails.</p>
        <p>The overall goal is to make travel planning a seamless and simplified process.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Defining the target users</p>
        <p>At the start of the project, the target users weren’t clearly defined because I thought it won’t affect the design process but I soon discovered at the start of the research process that it would be crucial to each stage of the design process. The target user was then defined as young people and adults who travel often or enjoy traveling as they fit the product vision.</p>

    <section class="section-four">
        <p class="section-pretitle">Starting out</p>
        <p class="section-title">Understanding the general feeling and thoughts toward travel planning.</p>
        <p>At the early stage of the whole idea, I had spoken to a friend who recently traveled and was sharing her experience with me about the planning process and how it was quite tedious considering it was a group trip. This conversation gave me an insight into the struggles experienced in trip planning, especially with group travel, so I had to speak to other travelers and people who’d like to travel to understand their travel planning expectations, experience, and their needs.</p>
        <p>To get this information, I interviewed 5 frequent travelers virtually and conducted a survey with 20 persons who travel and some who haven’t but would like to travel. I was aiming to understand the process they typically go through in trip planning, learn about difficulties they experience during the process, what improvements they might make, and uncover expectations during the travel planning process and upon arrival to their destination.</p>

    <section class="section-five">
        <p class="section-title">Comparing Products in the market</p>
        <p>The insights I got from the initial research phase regarding how people currently carry out travel bookings and planning prompted me to find out about existing products in the market. I was primarily comparing the functionalities, visual design, and user experience across 4 products- TripIt: Travel Planner, Wanderlog, Skyscanner, and Travelstart.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Competitive-analysis.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>This phase gave a bit more direction on how the idea can be created taking into consideration the gaps and weaknesses identified in the competitors.</p>

    <section class="section-six">
        <p class="section-title">Representing user’s needs and points of view on the problem</p>
        <p>Using the data and insight gathered from the user research, I had to create a better representation of the targeted users to help guide the product direction and guide the decision-making process. I identified 2 categories and scenarios of travel planners as well as the unique pain points and goals for each user type.</p>

    <section class="section-seven">
        <p class="section-title">Aligning business goals and identified user needs</p>
        <p>Right after creating personas, I had some ideas on what an ideal solution would be, then I realized it was important to understand and align the ideas with the business vision and goals for the product. To effectively visualize this, I created a lean UX Canvas.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/lean2.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>The main insight gained from this phase was aligning the business problem and expected outcomes to inform the product direction, taking note of the identified user needs in crafting value propositions.</p>

    <section class="section-eight">
        <p class="section-title">Visualizing the users’ journey</p>
        <p>While I had gotten a good representation of the prospective users and identified the value propositions of the business, I needed to visualize the user journey using user stories created in a context where the product is being used to map out the use cases, also to identify potential edge cases and opportunities for improvement in the product.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/user-journey.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>This helped me identify the various steps and opportunities that would be involved in the use of the product, so I needed a better visualization of how the app features and functions would flow in order to create a seamless experience. I created the flow chart noting data collection points in the process to help with the development.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Wireframing and Prototyping the Early Version</p>
        <p>Using the information architecture from the flow chart, I identified the pages and features required, so I drafted digital wireframes and created a prototype showing the functionalities and layout of the app content. This was to easily iterate on the layout and also get early feedback through usability testing.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Travelr_Wireframe.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Testing, first phase</p>
        <p>While wireframing the trip plan page, i had 2 ideas for the layout which i designed and in order to validate the choice of one, i conducted an unmoderated A/B Testing using maze to understand user’s perspective on each.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/B Test.png" alt=""></div>
        <p class="big-text">The main insights from the process</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 out of the 5 participants preferred screen B to Screen A and their reasons involved the ease of accessing all important information without going back and forth on the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold-text">This led to an iteration to fit better usability and improve overall experience.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Visual design guide</p>
        <p>After refining the low-fidelity designs, I started to create a style guide and system to guide the visual design process.</p>
        <p>The primary color, a gradient with a mix of orange and pink was chosen to give an exciting feel to the app, as it is involved in the early phase of a travel experience. The font family, Manrope was also chosen for clear readability and also to portray a slightly playful and friendly feel as a result of the rounded edges of the typefaces.</p>

        <p class="section-pretitle" id="final-prototype">Presenting a simplified travel planning Experience</p>
        <p class="section-title">Onboarding and personalizing experience</p>
        <p>The onboarding experience for new users was designed to inform them of the ways they can achieve their trip planning goals in 3 swipes, they also get to select some of their interests so that they get suggestions tailored to their interests.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Travelr_Onboarding and personalizing experience.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Home and Discovery</p>
        <p>Getting into the app, the homepage is structured in a way that provides suggestions on trip destinations based on each user’s interest, there are travel guides, bucket list activities also based on the users’ interests. There’s a search box that would help to easily search a place and get relevant information.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Travelr_Home and Discovery.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Planning a new trip</p>
        <p>The process of planning trips could easily become scattered and exhausting as observed from the research phase. To make this a well-streamlined process, the user starts a new trip plan by inputting basic key details to set up the planning process, they also get to add friends as collaborators and set trip budgets.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Travelr_Preview GIF X Planning a new trip.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Setting up and exploring the trip plan</p>
        <p>Once the trip plan is initially set up, the sections make the planning process easy by making important information based on the travel destination easily accessible. This includes the explore section showing booking and travel information tailored to the destination, a trip plan containing itinerary, notes, and booking details; the budget section where expenses can be allocated among collaborators</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Travelr_Setting up and exploring the trip plan.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p>This shows the user’s account information page designed in a segmented order to make it easy to find information.</p>

    <section class="section-ten">
        <p class="section-title">Testing, second phase</p>
        <p>On completion of the high fidelity designs, i conducted a moderated usability study involving 7 participants remotely using maze. The goal was to identify usability issues and confusing areas in the product, and this was highly eye opening to areas where users had issues as opposed to how i thought certain things were intuitive.</p>

        <p class="section-subtitle">Key Findings</p>
        <p class="light-grey">The process involved 4 tasks and a system usability scale (SUS) at the end of the process</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 out of 7 of the participants went off the expected path at the task of creating a new trip plan</li>
            <li>3 out of 7 of the participants were confused on the difference between the functionalities of the explore and trip plan page while trying to achieve their main aim which is planning trips.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <p class="section-title">Conclusion :)</p>
        <p>This project was a very exciting one for me because it involved and combined some of my favorite things [travel, exploration, and user experience]. I enjoyed the research and design phase, understanding the issues and fears people have around planning trips then crafting a solution to those issues.</p>
        <p>Although I was unable to conduct a proper usability test due to time constraints, I conducted a survey with a few people physically around me to get feedbacks on the product and this generated positive feedbacks. Moving forward, I hope to conduct a usability test and get feedbacks on key points in the product. Overall I enjoyed working on this project.</p>
