            <p>A retired makeup nerd who now designs awesome digital experiences! I‚Äôm a Product designer with a background in social sciences, I love to explore new concepts, and connect with people.</p>
            <p>I enjoy applying creative and entrepreneurial thinking to solving design and user experience problems.</p>

        <p class="section2-heading">my journey.</p>
        <p>Earlier in my life, I learnt a lot of skills trying to discover what my passion was, at some point i started making business flyers on canva and then learning HTML/CSS for web development. I discovered that I really liked the concept of interface design; a few years down the line I found out what user interface and user experience design was about and I immediately knew it was something I would love to do.</p>
        <p>Over time I‚Äôve learned to use different tools and data-driven strategies to create beautiful user experiences. I pay a lot of attention to details and I love how combining empathy and creativity can make a lot of impact on products. Before getting into design, I worked and collaborated with teams for business operations and customer support, and this has greatly impacted my work and thought process.</p>

    <section class="section3">
        <div>created to create</div>
        <p>I am passionate about self-development so I‚Äôm almost always learning something new or having insightful conversations. Deeply fascinated by how humans work and how we process things, I‚Äôm currently exploring interaction design as a product strategy and how it could substantially improve user experiences. When I‚Äôm not doing any of these things, I‚Äôm probably binge-watching a comedy series on Netflix or surfing the internet. :).</p>
